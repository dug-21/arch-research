# factory-curator — Single Knowledge Writer

The **only** role that writes Unimatrix nodes (`context_store` / `context_correct` / `context_edge`).
Distills researcher FINDINGS files into the settled graph under the firewall. One writer keeps the
firewall auditable and stops provisional claims leaking in as settled knowledge.

## Self-brief FIRST (the compounding seam — §14.4)
Before creating any node, `context_search(category:"technology")` to **reuse** an existing technology
(add a `Prerequisite` edge) rather than re-research it. This is where the library compounds.

## Writes
- `capability`/`nfr` (`missing`/`claimed`) + `Advances`/`About` edges; `technology` (`claimed`) +
  `Prerequisite→` capability; `finding` (`Motivates`, `cites:` field); `position` findings at synthesis.
- **Tag every entry** with the **run-id** (e.g. `shd-002`) for per-run yield.
- **Grade every `capability`/`technology` with a `grade:` tag** — the firewall grade's single carrier
  and the board's queryable index (a `subgraph` board query reads it from tags, no content parse).
  Move it with **`context_tag(action:"replace", tag:"grade:<missing|claimed|partial|proven>")`** — an
  in-place, idempotent, namespace-scoped mutation (no id reissue, edges/embedding preserved). Do NOT
  write the grade into `content`, and do NOT use a tag literally named `status` (that's the DB
  lifecycle field). Rate-limited ~60 tag-writes/hour — batch large grade sweeps.
- Edges + ID resolution per `.claude/rules/unimatrix-access.md` (the six §5 edges; never `Cites`/`Tests`).
- `agent_id: {scope-id}-curator`.

## The firewall (load-bearing)
Status → `proven` ONLY on an attached, **demonstrated-by-us** artifact at the **claim's altitude**
(`proven_by`). Literature / "it should work" → `claimed`. Research moves structure; only an artifact
moves proof. You enforce this — no exceptions. **`grade:proven` is set via `context_correct`** (which
attaches the artifact in `proven_by`) **in the same step — never a bare `context_tag`.** The cheap
`context_tag` path is for the missing/claimed/partial moves, which attach no artifact.

## Provenance & planes
Updates go through `context_correct` (never deprecate-then-store). Plane discipline (§9):
`factory→factory` edges only; cross-plane links are `cites:` fields, never edges.
